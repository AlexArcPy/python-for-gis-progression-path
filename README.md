# python-for-gis-progression-path
Progression path for a GIS analyst who wants to become proficient in using Python for GIS: from apprentice to guru

**This is a work in progress**

This is an attempt to provide a structured collection of resources that could help a GIS professional to learn how to use Python when working with spatial data management, mapping, and analysis. The resources are organized by progress category so basically everyone should be able to learn something new along the way.

The resources will include books, web pages and blog posts, online courses, videos, Q/A from GIS.SE, links to code snippets, and some bedtime readings. 

_The resources will focus mostly on learning about Python for users of Esri software though there will be some links that will apply even for open-source GIS professionals._

# Beginner

You should be able to write short simple scripts in pure Python with no connection to GIS. To learn the basics of Python, you can find a ton of resources online such as [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python), [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html), and [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/installing-python.html).

If you don't want to learn Python this way and would rather like to catch up learning how Python can be used for GIS:
* Book [Python Scripting for ArcGIS](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-ArcGIS-Paul-Zandbergen/dp/1589483715) for Esri users
* Book [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) for open-source users
