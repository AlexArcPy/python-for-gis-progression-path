# python-for-gis-progression-path
Progression path for a GIS analyst who wants to become proficient in using Python for GIS: from apprentice to guru

**This is a work in progress**

This is an attempt to provide a structured collection of resources that could help a GIS professional to learn how to use Python when working with spatial data management, mapping, and analysis. The resources are organized by progress category so basically everyone should be able to learn something new along the way.

The resources will include books, web pages and blog posts, online courses, videos, Q/A from GIS.SE, links to code snippets, and some bedtime readings. 

_The resources will focus mostly on learning about Python for users of Esri software though there will be some links that will apply even for open-source GIS professionals._

# Beginner

You should be able to write short simple scripts in pure Python with no connection to GIS. To learn the basics of Python, you can find a ton of resources online such as [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python), [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html), [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/installing-python.html), and many other books from [Python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks).

## Resources
If you don't want to learn Python this way and would rather like to catch up learning how Python can be used for GIS:
* Book [Python Scripting for ArcGIS](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-ArcGIS-Paul-Zandbergen/dp/1589483715) for Esri users. Going through this book is sufficient to learn everything you might ever need;
* Instructor-led course [Introduction to Geoprocessing Scripts Using Python](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57630435851d31e02a43f054/introduction-to-geoprocessing-scripts-using-python/);
* Book [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) for open-source users;
* Book [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) (free)

## Skills

### GIS specific
At this point, you should be able:
- to write some simple scripts either using arcpy site-package or `ogr/gdal` libraries;
- to report information about your GIS assets (data format, geometry type, data schema, spatial reference);
- to write code for calling ArcGIS GP tools from Python code and inspect the `Result` object returned;
- to perform an operation on multiple datasets in batch mode using `arcpy` listing functions (eg. copy multiple shapefiles into a file geodatabase at once, re-project all  rasters in a folder);
- to read and update attributes & geometry of features using `arcpy.da` cursors;
- to create and operate `arcpy.Geometry()` objects (accessing both their properties and methods);
- to create an ArcGIS toolbox with a script tool executing a Python source file;
- to report information about map layers (eg. data sources, broken paths, definition queries) within a map document (.mxd) using `arcpy.mapping` module.

### Python
At this point, you should be familiar with:
- variables of different data types (numeric, string, date etc.);
- data structures of different types (list, tuple, dictionary, set);
- `for` and `while` loops, `if-elif-else` blocks;
- import of external Python modules and packages (eg. `import os`);
- functions and how they work (eg. input arguments and `return` statement);
- reading/writing of text files using the `os` module;

### Exercises
This section contains the examples of tasks that you might need to write at some point of time. Implementing these tasks in Python code would be a good sign that you have mastered the basics of Python for ArcGIS.
- get a list field names of Date type in a file geodatabase feature class;



# Intermediate

## Resources
* Learn about [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) such as Git for managing the source code. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) by Atlassian and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) provides free private repositories and [GitHub](https://github.com/) provides free public repositories (you need to pay to create private ones).
 - Find out whether there is a VCS solution deployed in-house within your organization, such as [Microsoft TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/), which you could use to check in the code;
 
* Watch [Python Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-fundamentals/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight;


## Skills
### GIS specific
- to automate map production using `arcpy.mapping` with data-driven pages;
- to manage .pdf files (eg. re-ordering, merging, splitting);
- to export map document to various file formats such as .png and .pdf;
- update text elements content in layout of map document;
- executing DBMS spatial functions from Python and using `arcpy.ArcSDESQLExecute()`;


### Python
At this point, you should be familiar with:
- Python 3 to able to write code that will be ported later to ArcGIS Pro;
- [Python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/);
- `collections` module data structures such as `defaultdict`, `namedtuple`, `Counter`
- list and dictionary comprehensions;
- set comprehensions and set theory operations;
- enumerating sequences using built-in `enumerate` function';
- writing own functions and handling the arguments;
- lambda functions;
- convenience functions such as those in [arcapi](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/arcapi);
- accessing databases using Python;
- working with disk-based database SQLite from Python;





# Advanced

## Resources
* Learn about how to use ArcObjects from Python:
 - [Accessing ArcObjects from Python?](http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/110/14435)
* Learn about other GIS packages. Go through a comprehensive list of [Essential Python Geospatial Libraries](http://carsonfarmer.com/2013/07/essential-python-geo-libraries/) (also available on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/SpatialPython/spatial_python/blob/master/packages.md). 
 - watch the series of recorded workshops on using open source GIS packages: [Geospatial data in Python: Database, Desktop, and the Web](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/carson-farmer.html)
 
* Learn about how to build desktop GUI applications using PyQt, PySide, or Kivy and then embed them into ArcGIS or just let them be aware of spatial datasets. 
 - Watch Esri video [Developing Custom Tools with PyQt](http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=4549&isLegacy=true&title=developing-custom-tools-with-pyqt).
* Learn about using Python for web development:
 - learn [`flask`](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [`django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Start with flask and only then move to Django.
 - learn [`geodjango`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/gis/) to serve spatial datasets on the web. Read through pdf [ArcGIS JavaScript Plus Django Equals Dynamic Web App](http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc15/papers/794_139.pdf);

* Watch [Python â€“ Beyond the Basics](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-beyond-basics/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight; 
* Learn about [`nlpk`](http://www.nltk.org/) Python package to work with human language data (eg. parsing address data);
* Learn about [`regex`](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html) Python package to work with regular expressions in Python (eg. finding addresses in a specific format);

* Install `Anaconda`(https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and learn about `conda`. This is helpful as [Python in ArcGIS Pro](https://geonet.esri.com/docs/DOC-8359) is implemented using a [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html) env. 

* Learn about managing and processing larger spatial datasets as performance will matter.
 - learn profiling techniques to find out what code takes most time to execute;
 - learn benchmarking to compare execution time for functions that do the same thing using different tools (eg. looking for the fastest way to count points in polygons);

* Start looking for doing certain things outside of ArcGIS such using `pandas` (eg. create a new csv file from an existing one by filtering certain rows without converting the csv file into a geodatabase table);

* Learn best practices for organizing configuration and settings for a larger workflow where you need to keep the config values apart from the business logic (eg. using JSON or ConfigParser or init() );
