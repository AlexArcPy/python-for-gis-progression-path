# python-for-gis-progression-path

Progression path for a GIS analyst who wants to become proficient in using Python for GIS: from apprentice to guru

**This is a work in progress**

This is an attempt to provide a structured collection of resources that could help a GIS professional to learn how to use Python when working with spatial data management, mapping, and analysis. The resources are organized by progress category so basically everyone should be able to learn something new along the way.

The resources will include books, web pages and blog posts, online courses, videos, Q/A from GIS.SE, links to code snippets, and some bedtime readings.

_The resources will be applicable both for Esri software users as well as open-source GIS professionals._

# Intermediate

## Resources

* Learn about [various Python IDEs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) and find out which one you like most. Many start with free [PyScripter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/) and then move to something else:
  * SO question [What IDE to use for Python?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81584/what-ide-to-use-for-python)
  * Check PyCharm, WingIDE, Eclipse PyDev, Visual Studio Code, Python Tools for Visual Studio, or rich text editors such as [Sublime with Python support](https://www.fullstackpython.com/sublime-text.html)
  * Check Esri blog post [Choosing the right Python Integrated Development Environment](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/06/24/choosing-the-right-python-integrated-development-environment/)

Now, for getting started with Python development, [Visual Studio Code with Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) extension(s) is arguably the best choice. It's completely free, you can install it on any of your physical or virtual machines and it has great support for Python development. Choosing between commercial IDEs, Wing IDE or PyCharm would be a great choice.

* Learn about [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) such as `Git` for managing the source code. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) by Atlassian and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) provides free private repositories and [GitHub](https://github.com/) provides free public repositories (you need to pay to create private ones).
  * Find out whether there is a VCS solution deployed in-house within your organization, such as [Microsoft TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/), which you could use to check in the code
  * Should you like to dive deeper into `Git`, read the [Git Pro book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for free online

* Watch Python courses on training sites such as Pluralsight [Python Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-fundamentals/table-of-contents, Enthought [Python Foundation Series](https://www.enthought.com/services/training/python-training-on-demand/) or [Safari Books online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* Watch Esri video [Python: Useful Libraries for the GIS Professional](http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2938&isLegacy=true&title=python-useful-libraries-for-the-gis-professional)

* Learn about [type hinting in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). There is an [excellent blog post on how type hints are used in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html) and a [help page from Wing IDE people](https://wingware.com/doc/edit/helping-wing-analyze-code). Find out  whether your Python IDE supports static code analysis and start using the type hints (with support both for Python 2.7 and 3.5+).
  * Learn about [MyPy static type checker](http://mypy-lang.org/) and support for type hints with the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module in Python 3.6

* Learn how run other Python programs or executable files from your program using `subprocess` module. This is handy when you need to run an `.exe` program in the middle of your Python program. This is often the case when you use `arcpy` / `ogr` code in the beginning of the script, but then need to run ArcObjects console app / compiled C++ app to get something done before you can proceed further.

  * Parse existing `.xml` files using built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree` class and 3rd party package [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/)

* Learn about source code testing, linting, and refactoring:
  * Learn `unittest` built-in module and more advanced [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework
  * Learn [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.1/) module to create code coverage reports
  * Learn [`Hypothesis`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for writing more powerful unit tests
  * Learn Python linters such as `pylint`, `flake8`, and `pyflakes8` to keep the code tidy
  * Learn about Python style guides such as [Google style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md). This will be particular useful when you start working in a team
  * Learn about most comprehensive Python linter [`wemake-python-styleguide`
](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide). It is just a `flake8` plugin; however, it combines violations from a lot of other `flake8` plugins
  * Learn Python formatters such `yapf` and `autopep8` to automatically reformat the source code to conform to a style. It is best to run `autopep8` with aggressive option enabled to reformat the code and then run `yapf` on the result code
  * Learn [SonarPython](https://rules.sonarsource.com/python) static code analyzer to find code smells and refactoring options. Many of the rules from `SonarPython` are implemented in `wemake-python-styleguide`
  * Learn about Python interface files ([PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)) and how to use them to [help your Python IDE to do static code analysis](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/type-hinting-in-product.html#pep484) and provide better intellisense

* Start looking for doing certain things outside of GIS applications using pure Python, for instance, using `pandas`

* Learn best practices for organizing configuration and settings for a larger workflow where you need to keep the config values separately from the business logic (eg. using `json`, `ConfigParser` or using OOP constructors)

* Learn about extending Python with C or C++:
  * Learn how to [create a C++ extension for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/cpp-and-python) (`.pyd` compiled file that can be imported as a regular module into Python module)
  * Go through the [Interfacing with other languages](https://training.enthought.com/course/INTERFACING) course from Enthought to start building Python native modules
  * Learn and compare various [alternatives for wrapping C++ code for Python](http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c++-wrapping.html) such as using [`Boost`](https://www.boost.org/), [`SWIG`](http://www.swig.org/), native [Python C API](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html), and [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). `pybind11` is the most user-friendly one

## Skills

### GIS specific

At this point, you should be able to:

* execute ArcObjects code from Python using `comtypes` library
* export the data from tables and feature classes into Excel with custom formatting using `xlsxwriter`
* generate `.pdf` files from scratch that would contain map images, custom charts, and tables using `reportlab`
* split, merge, crop, and transform `.pdf` documents using `pypdf2`
* generate `.pdf` report files using ArcGIS report templates (`.rlf`) and `arcpy`
* generate graphs using `arcpy.Graph`, `arcpy.GraphTemplate` with graph template files (`.tee`), and Make Graph GP tool
* perform graph theory operations on linear datasets using `networkx` (eg. point-to-point routing)
* plot geodata with `Matplotlib` (both vector and raster)
* use `numpy` and `pandas` for manipulating spatial dataset attribute table
* use `requests` and/or `arcrest` package to access ArcGIS Server site, ArcGIS Online / Portal organizations through the ArcGIS REST API
* call FME workbenches from Python
* access readers and writers in FME with `fmeobjects`
* read, modify, and write a georeferenced image
* generate useful information about a point dataset (most isolated points, a pair of two furthest points, etc)

### Python

At this point, you should be familiar with:

* building desktop GUI applications using PyQt, PySide, or Kivy (eg. visualize a shapefile's features in an application window)
* contributing to open-source projects such as `arcrest` or `geopandas` reporting bugs or pulling in new functionality
* creating new `conda` environments and installing various packages into specific environments
* refactoring wrapping the code into functions, modules, and packages
* OOP basics and creating own classes
* compile a simple Python extension module (`.pyd`) and write a `.pyi` interface file to provide the intellisense for your Python IDE

### Exercises

This section contains the examples of tasks that you might need to write at some point of time. Implementing these tasks in Python code would be a good sign that you have mastered the advanced concepts of Python for GIS.

* hide/show map grid of data frame in a map layout before exporting the map in a map document using `arcpy` package and ArcObjects
* update label's text of a scale bar in a map layout using pure ArcObjects
* generate a service area (drive-time) polygon for an arbitrary point on a street network stored as a shapefile using `networkx`
* find out the fastest spatial join - ArcGIS Spatial Join GP tool, `rtree` in PostGIS, SQL Server `STContains`, or `shapely` Python package
* create a new .csv file from an existing one by filtering certain rows using `pandas`
* classify point dataset features into clusters using `scikit-learn` to mimic some of the ArcGIS Spatial Statistics tools
* write a program that will calculate the area of a lake automatically recognized from a satellite imagery
* build with the help of `PyQt` a GUI application for executing SQL queries against file geodatabases
