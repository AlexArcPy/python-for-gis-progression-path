# python-for-gis-progression-path
Progression path for a GIS analyst who wants to become proficient in using Python for GIS: from apprentice to guru

**This is a work in progress**

This is an attempt to provide a structured collection of resources that could help a GIS professional to learn how to use Python when working with spatial data management, mapping, and analysis. The resources are organized by progress category so basically everyone should be able to learn something new along the way.

The resources will include books, web pages and blog posts, online courses, videos, Q/A from GIS.SE, links to code snippets, and some bedtime readings. 

_The resources will focus mostly on learning about Python for users of Esri software though many topics will apply for open-source GIS professionals as well._
